Phone App:
- emphasis on simple form
- perhaps users are authorized by 6 digit tokens sent by the school, maybe they have to put in information and be confirmed by the school
- build in (but not necessarily implement) potential for authorization to be instigated by either users or the school
- name queries will likely need to depend on roles and how schools organize their own databases
    - depends on who can have access to what and how we do authorization
    - if we can't query names, perhaps they get set as 'pending' until an administrator can identify the correct student
- users may be able to see past reports, but should not be able to modify them
    - potentially build out follow-up reports
- add a "clear description" button
- add a prompt for high severity reports telling the user that the app does not take action; if this is a life threatening event call 911; if immediate action should be taken, notify school counselors
- examples for severity should be not on the screen all the time. Suggested: info button that shows examples for severity levels
- have a legal liability page for reports or on downloading the app. This is meant to be an information reporting system only. It does not notify police or authorities. See prompt for high severity reports.
- add optional training or examples for the app in hamburger menu type thing

Database:
- Maybe store baseline reports for students/users to track how often they give/recieve reports
- Track events to be used for analyzing if reports helped predict events
- Add status for reports (i.e. new, resolved, high priority)
- Track what responses have been taken for reports
- Users table for webapp and users table for phone app should be separate

Webapp:
- Role-based access; levels unknown, could depend on how school wants to use it
- ideally customizable and granular (give access to specific reports or specific users)
- students should be ranked by weighted concern (how recent are their reports, how severe, how frequent)
- Show when action has been taken as a response to a report
- Send admin push notification/email if a critical flag is recognized (stub at least)
- Should also have liability warning that this app does not take any actions other than notifying admin

Miscellaneous
- Assume that the data for this app is limited to one school and completely separate

TODO:
- deep dive prototype
- get info from mental health experts and authorities working with IM
- get examples of severity from mental health experts
