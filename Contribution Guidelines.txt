Contributing Guidelines


Adding/Modifying Features
* Each independent feature should be on a separate branch that can be pushed to master as frequently as needed.
* Prior to pushing, each feature should be tested locally. Should a push cause potential conflicts for any 
	other area of code (what someone else is working on), ping them on Discord to let them know you might break 
	their stuff. Bugs should be reported and added to the trello board for fixing.
* Each feature should be completely contained in one or more commits (IM can choose which features they would 
	like at the end -- fixup! Is a useful command to keep in mind if there need to be bug fixes later on).
* Useful commit messages should describe each feature commit.

Formatting
* To keep the code clean, the front end has a linter that runs every time the project is built. Before merging 
	a branch, any lint errors should be fixed. Additionally, on the backend all files should be auto-formatted 
	by Visual Studio to ensure consistency.

Continuous Integration
* Every two weeks, code in development will be merged into master and deployed to the server. Then, the IM team 
	will be able to view the deployed site and keep up with progress.
